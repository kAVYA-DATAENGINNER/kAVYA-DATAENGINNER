## 🧰 What’s This Portfolio About?

This portfolio is a hands-on showcase of my work with **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** and other modern data engineering tools. It features real-world scenarios demonstrating how to build scalable, efficient, and secure data pipelines across various business use cases.

Each folder in this repository contains a **standalone use case** — from simple copy activities to complex, multi-step ETL workflows.

### ✨ What you'll find:
- 📂 ADF Pipelines (Excel to SQL, Blob to Synapse, etc.)
- 🛠️ Schema design tailored to source structures
- 🔄 Data transformation logic
- 🔗 Integration with various services (Blob, SQL, API, Snowflake, etc.)
- 📈 Sample queries and SQL scripts
- 📝 Clean documentation to walk you through each project

## 📚 Why I Created This

As a data engineer, I believe portfolios should reflect **more than just code**. They should tell a story of **problem-solving, architecture, design choices**, and learning along the way.

This repo is for:
- Recruiters and hiring managers to get a glimpse of my practical skills  
- Fellow engineers to learn and collaborate  
- Me — to reflect on my journey and continue evolving

## 🔍 Use Case Example: Excel to SQL Pipeline

One of the projects here involves moving data from an Excel file into an Azure SQL Database using ADF.  
It showcases:
- How to design a SQL schema from scratch based on Excel columns
- Creating linked services and datasets in ADF
- Mapping and transformation using Copy Activity
- Logging and monitoring for successful data movement
